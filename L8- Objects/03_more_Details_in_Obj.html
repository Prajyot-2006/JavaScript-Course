 <!--we learned about bracket notation-->
 <!--bracket notation lets us use the property that dont work with dot notation-->

            const product2 = {
                name: 'Tshirt',
                price: 500
            };

// we can also acces value in object using another way in JS 
            console.log(product2.name);
            console.log(product2['name']);  // it does the same work as shown above

// why we use bracket notation ? the reason is below
            console.log(product2.deliver-time);  // gives an error bcoz JS thinks we are doing math here after reading - sign
            console.log(product2['delivery-time']);  // it works fine , and bcoz delivery-time does not exist in the object thats why it will give undefined as a result

// using bracket notation we can aslo add values to the object or create a property 
            const product3 = {
                name2: 'sandal',
                ['delivery-time']: '1 day'
            };

// inside an obj we can save any type of values as shown in below 
            const obj1 = {
                name3: 'Gon',
                height: 4,
                obj2: {  // this also can be called a snested objects
                    name4: 'Killua',
                    height1: 4.6
                },
                fun: function function1(){  // a function is also a anothe rtype of value in JS
                    console.log('function inside object')
                }
            };

            console.log(obj1.obj2.name4);  // we do like this to access the nested object 
            obj1.fun()  // we do like this to access the function or to call the function which is inside an object

 <!--Use dot notation by default-->
 <!-- use the bracket notation for the property that dont work with dot notation  -->
<!--function inside object is called as method-->
<!--console.log() is an best exammple for function inside object 
console is a object provided by JS and log is a function 
also Math.random() : math is an object provided by JS and random is an function-->
