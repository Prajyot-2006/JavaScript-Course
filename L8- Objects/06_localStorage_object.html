<script>
    localStorage.setItem('message','hello'); // its syntax is localStorage.setItem('name','value'); localstorage only supports string 
    const a = localStorage.getItem('message'); // so using localstorage we are able to get the value that we saved earlier even though we refresh the page
    console.log(a);
// message is a special variable created in local storage ans its value is set to be hello
</script>

Note : while dry coding the local storage code first dry code get then only do set

🔁 Correct Dry Run Order:
getItem() is used first → to read any existing data from localStorage.
Then later setItem() is used → to save new or updated data.

💡 Simple Explanation:
🔹 getItem():
Reads what is already saved.
Used first when the page loads or when you want to get stored values.

🔹 setItem():
Writes (saves) something new.
Used after something changes (e.g., after button click or calculation).

let store = localStorage.getItem('calculation')

so in get item at first nothing is saved ? 
so we can assume in localstorage variable like calculation has a null value inside it ?
chatgpt answer : ✅ Yes, you're 100% correct.
✅ Conclusion:
Yes, when nothing is saved yet, you can assume:
localStorage.getItem('calculation') === null
