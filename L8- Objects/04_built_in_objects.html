<!--console and math(math.round) objects are known as built in objects-->
<!--2 more built in objects JSON and localStorage-->
<!--JSON built in object : its characteristics are s follows
- help us work with JSON(it stands for Javascript Object Notation)
- its basically a syntax 
- it is similar to javascript object
- but has less features

-->

<!--let us understand it properly-->

<!--This is javascript object-->
{
    name3: 'Gon',
    height: 4,
    obj2: {  // this also can be called a snested objects
        name4: 'Killua',
        height1: 4.6
    },
    fun: function function1(){  // a function is also a anothe rtype of value in JS
        console.log('function inside object')
    }
};

<!--This is JSON object-->
{
    "name3": "Gon",
    "height": 4,
    "obj2": {  // this also can be called a snested objects
        "name4": 'Killua',
        "height1": 4.6
    }
};
<!--
The differnece is that all property in strings must use "" in JSON , JSON doesnot support ''
JSON
JSON doesnot support functions

- its basically a syntax 
- it is similar to javascript object
- but has less features
-->

<!--
We use JSON when send data between computers
when we store data


-->

<!--Local storage :
- save values more permanentely
- we usually see when we refresh the outpiut page eg open live server in the file named ropckpaper_using_Obj2.html and in o/p play some game
and refresh after refreshing , the score card also refresh that means it starts form new 
- goto supersimple.dev/projects/objects and play some games and then refresh it doesnt becomes 0 




-->


<!-- Inshort : JS built in objects
console.log('hello');
Math.random();
JSON.stringify(object);
localStorage.getItem('score');
-->
