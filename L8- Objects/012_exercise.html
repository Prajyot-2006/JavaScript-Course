Challenge Exercises
8i. We’ll improve the coin flip game from exercise4.html from Boolean and if statement folder to be like the rock paper scissors game.
Copy the code from exercise4.html 
Create 2 buttons to play the game
  heads  tails

When clicking ‘heads’ play the game with guess = 'heads'.
When clicking ‘tails’ play the game with guess = 'tails'.
Create a function ‘playGame(guess)’ to reuse the code.

8j. Create a score object { wins: 0, losses: 0 }, update the score each time after playing, and display the score in the console.

8k. Use localStorage to save and load the score (hint: you’ll need to use JSON.stringify() to convert the score object to a string).

        }
        console.log(score);
//      localStorage.setItem('backup',score);  this is wrong localstorgae only support strings
        localStorage.setItem('backup', JSON.stringify(score));  // after playing a game and getting a score we have to save it in a localStorage
    // but we know localStorage only suports strings not object , we have score, stored in a object we first need to convert object into string using JSON to store it back in localStorage 


    }
    console.log('Previous score :',score);

Doubt solving : 
✅ This line:
const score = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('backup')) || { win: 0, loses: 0 };

When localStorage is empty (i.e. no 'backup' key):
localStorage.getItem('backup') → returns null
JSON.parse(null) → gives null
null || { win: 0, loses: 0 } → final result is { win: 0, loses: 0 }

✅ So the score variable stores: this first
{ win: 0, loses: 0 }
That is the first value stored in const score when localStorage is empty.
