We are learning about a variable feature which i havent learn or seen

<script>

// ✅ Example 1: Fruit choice
    let fruit = 'apple' || 'banana';
    console.log(fruit);  // o/p apple , Why? Because 'apple' is already a value, so JavaScript doesn’t even look at 'banana'

// ✅ Example 2: Empty value
    let fruit = '' || 'banana';
    console.log(fruit);  // o/p banana , Why? Because '' is empty, so JavaScript uses the second value 'banana'.

// ✅ Example 3: Null value
    let fruit = null || 'banana';
    console.log(fruit);  // o/p banana , Why? Because null means "nothing", so it moves to 'banana'.

    
/* 🔑 Rule in simple words:
A || B

If A is not empty, use A.
If A is empty, null, or false, use B.

*/


/* simple doubt clearence
in example 1 , A is not empty neither B why not use B it also has a value 
🧠 Rule of || (OR) in JavaScript:
A || B means:
Use A if A has any value.
Only go to B if A is empty, null, false, or 0.

🔍 So in this example:
let fruit = 'apple' || 'banana';
'apple' is not empty

So JavaScript says:
✅ “Yes! I found a value!”
❌ “No need to look at the second one!”
So it stops at 'apple' and never uses 'banana'.
