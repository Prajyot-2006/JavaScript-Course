<!--
6d. Imagine an amusement park that has a discount for children (6 years and younger) or seniors (65 years and older).

Create a variable age and save a person’s age inside.

Create an if-statement that checks if the person qualifies for a discount. If they do, display 'Discount' in the console. Otherwise, display 'No discount' in the console.
Note: try to use the || operator in your solution.

Try changing the age variable to display different messages.

<script>
    let age = 4;
    if(age<6 || age>65){
        console.log('Discount');
    }
    else{
        console.log('No discount');
    }

</script>
