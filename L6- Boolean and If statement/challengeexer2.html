<!--
6e. Continuing from exercise 6d, letâ€™s say the discount is only available if it is not a holiday. Create a variable: const isHoliday = true;

Update the code so that in order to get a discount, people must meet the age requirement and it is also not a holiday.

Note: && has a higher priority than || so you may need to use brackets () to control which code gets done first.

Try changing the value of isHoliday to display different messages

<script>
    
    let age = 4;
    const isHoliday = true;

    if(isHoliday && (age<6 || age>65) ){
        console.log('Discount');
    }

    else{
        console.log('No Discount');
    }

</script>
