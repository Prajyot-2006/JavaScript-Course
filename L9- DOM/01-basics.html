a DOM is another built-in object in JS , called the document object

<html>
    <head>
        <title>
            DOM
        </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <button>
            hello
        </button>
    </body>
</html>



<script>
    document.body.innerHTML = 'Hi';  // so this code removes everything on the page and replaces it with the text hello 
    // (if the webpage doesnt have any content then it wil not work)
/* 
document here is the built-in object of JS
body is the property of document object (we undestand this by seeing dot notation(.))
body is also an object
innerHTML is the property of body object (we undestand this by seeing dot notation(.))

document object conrtains propertes like body , title 
we used = signn to change the innerHTML property to the string hello
Note : document object and webpage are linked together
*/
    document.title = 'Good Job!';  // it changes the title from DOM to Good Job!

</script>
